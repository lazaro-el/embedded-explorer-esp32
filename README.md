# How to prepare

## Local development setup

This is the preferred and easiest way to start coding. It also allows you to build and test code for real hardware.

Needed software:

- Visual Studio Code  
- VS Code extensions:  
  - ESP-IDF <img width="296" height="73" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2be9cc4a-d679-4861-a5ef-3f68fe0e7c28" />
  - Wokwi Simulator <img width="296" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bea25088-4563-4697-88c2-e34434afa376" />

After installing everything, register on the website https://wokwi.com so you can use Wokwi inside VS Code. Copy the token from the website and paste it into the extension.

If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to build the code. The first build may take a few minutes. When you open the file diagram.json, you should be able to run the simulator.

Have fun coding.

## Remote development setup

If you cannot configure your system properly, you can use Wokwi for programming, building and simulation.

- Go to the website www.wokwi.com  
- Choose ESP32 then ESP-IDF Templates then ESP32  
- Copy the content from explorer_main.c into main.c  
- Copy the content of diagram.json from git into the web editor  

You should now be ready to code. Have fun.
